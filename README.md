Product risks:
* Integration Challenges: Integration with third-party systems, services, or APIs can introduce risks related to compatibility, data exchange, and interoperability, requiring thorough integration testing to validate seamless interaction.
* Performance and Scalability: Performance-related risks, such as slow response times, resource utilization issues, or scalability limitations, can impact user experience, system reliability, and the ability of the software to handle increasing loads over time.
* Security Vulnerabilities: Security risks, including vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or exposure to malicious attacks, can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, necessitating robust security testing to identify and address potential threats.
* Usability and Accessibility: Usability issues, navigation challenges, or accessibility barriers for users with disabilities can affect user satisfaction, adoption rates, and compliance with regulatory requirements, highlighting the importance of usability and accessibility testing.
* Platform and Device Compatibility: Compatibility risks associated with different operating systems, web browsers, devices, or screen resolutions can lead to inconsistencies in functionality, layout, or performance across platforms, requiring comprehensive compatibility testing.
* Data Integrity and Accuracy: Risks related to data integrity, accuracy, or consistency can arise from errors in data processing, storage, or manipulation, necessitating data validation and verification through thorough testing of data inputs, outputs, and calculations.
* Fault Tolerance and Disaster Recovery: Risks associated with system failures, downtime, or data loss due to hardware failures, software bugs, or natural disasters can impact business continuity and operational resilience, requiring testing of fault tolerance mechanisms and disaster recovery procedures.
* Localization and Internationalization: Risks related to localization (adapting the software for specific languages, cultures, or regions) and internationalization (designing the software to support global markets) can affect usability, functionality, and acceptance in diverse markets, necessitating localization and internationalization testing.

2.2. Test analysis
* The next functionalities will be tested: View an order, Filter an order, Manually Adding/Modifying an order.

#### 3.Conclusions

After Testing the functionalities for View an Order, Filter an Order, Manually Adding/Modifying an Order, I have reached the following conclusions:
* View an Order: The functionalities tested for the correct visualization of the Sales module have been well implemented, so that an admin can have all the details about the site's orders at his fingertips in a table. The checkbox, sorting, navigating among the orders is easy and no aspects were found that require changes.
* Filter an Order: The methods of filtering orders by 'Order ID', 'Customer', 'Order Status', 'Total $' depend on 'Added Date' and 'Modified Date', but in these tests performed in some positive conditions, there were no noticed problems to solve.
* Manually Adding/Modifying an Order:
  
The BAMM-31 story was based on testing the addition of new commands and everything involving the add order button. Even if the functionality of the button itself was well implemented, major problems were found with command values exceeding 100.000.000.000$, a bug was reported and requires attention to be fixed.

The tests carried out within the BAMM-32 story followed functionalities such as modifying commands and deleting them. The tested functionalities are well implemented and easy to use, but two minor problems related to the deletion of orders were also found, bugs were reported. The two defects found do not affect the proper functioning of the functionalities.

In total there are 4 stories covered by 17 tests, each of those tests were written and executed as shown above in 2.5. section.

In 2 of the 4 stories, 3 bugs were discovered that were reported and fixed. These have minor severity, with medium priority. These are defects that do not lead to failure and can be solved during the development activities.

In general, the tests had a satisfactory finality and a perfect functionality. It is recommended to make adjustments on the minor aspects discovered to provide a better quality and experience for the admin and not only.
